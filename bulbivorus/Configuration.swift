     List of routes to service.
     
     Overlapping routes are legal, but earlier matches will supercede later matches.
     Thus, a list of matches like this:
        ["/hi.*", "/hilarious", "/.*"]
     Will fire the first route on "/hilarious", and the last route on "/funny", and
     never fire the second route.
     
     A list of matches like:
        ["/hilarious", "/hi.*", "/.*"]
     Would fire the first route on "/hilarious", the second on "/hilarity", and the
     last on "/funny"
